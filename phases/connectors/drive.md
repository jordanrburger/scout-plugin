## Google Drive Inbound Scan — Document Activity

Check for recently modified documents, meeting notes, and shared files in Google Drive.

### Recent Document Activity

Use `list_recent_files` or `search_files` with date filters to find documents modified since the last run. Focus on:

1. **Meeting notes documents** — shared docs used for meeting agendas and notes. These often contain action items written collaboratively during meetings.
2. **Shared documents** — files shared with {{USER_NAME}} or files in shared folders that were recently updated. New shares or edits may indicate:
   - Someone needs {{USER_NAME}}'s review or input
   - A deliverable was completed and shared
   - Collaborative work is in progress
3. **Documents {{USER_NAME}} edited** — files modified by {{USER_NAME}} are evidence of completed work.

### Cross-Reference with Transcript Tools

**Cross-reference with meeting transcript tools (e.g., Granola).** Some meetings appear in Drive but not in transcript tools, and vice versa:
- A Google Doc titled "Meeting Notes — [Topic]" may have structured notes that a transcript tool missed
- A transcript tool may have captured audio that wasn't documented in Drive
- If both exist for the same meeting, **synthesize the best information from each** — use the transcript for exact quotes and commitments, use the Drive doc for structured decisions and action items

### What to Extract

For each relevant document found:
- **Document title and link**
- **Who modified it** and when
- **Action items** written in the document (look for checkbox items, "TODO," "Action:" patterns)
- **Decisions** documented
- **Whether this relates to a known project** (link to KB project file)

## Google Drive Query — Briefing Data Gathering

### Recent Meeting Notes

Use `search_files` to find recently modified meeting notes or documents (past 24 hours). Search for:
- Files with "meeting notes," "agenda," "minutes" in the title
- Files in shared folders associated with active projects
- Files recently shared with {{USER_NAME}}

### Complement Transcript Tools

Drive documents may complement what transcript tools capture. For today's briefing:
1. Check if any of yesterday's meetings have associated Google Docs with notes
2. If a transcript exists AND a Drive doc exists for the same meeting, use both sources
3. If only a Drive doc exists (no transcript), treat the doc as the primary meeting record
4. If only a transcript exists (no Drive doc), the transcript is the primary source

### Collaborative Documents

Check for documents where multiple people have been making edits — these indicate active collaborative work and may contain action items, decisions, or context updates that don't appear in any other connector.

Use `read_file_content` for documents that appear particularly relevant to current projects or action items.
